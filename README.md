# House Price Prediction Kaggle Competition

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using data from the Kaggle competition "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques". The dataset includes various features of houses that can influence their sale prices.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models and model evaluation results.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of two main files:
- `train.csv`: Training data with house features and their corresponding sale prices.
- `test.csv`: Test data with house features for which we need to predict the sale prices.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/rahmankhan2241/House-Price-Prediction-Kaggle-Competition.git
